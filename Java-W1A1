(1) what are the features of programming language ?
(A) ->Algorithm or pseudo code and syntax are the two main features of programming language.
    ->Algorithm is nothing but a skeleton of the program.
    ->Syntax is the form of the program.
    ->There are many programming languages like c, c++, java...The main difference between all 
      the programming languages is syntax. There is very less changes in use of algorithm in
      different programming languages.

(2) What is compiler ?
(A) ->Compiler is a software that can convert the program code into assembly language.
    ->Different programming languages has different compilers designed by the owners of that
      programming language.
    ->Compiler stores the compiled data in the memory unit.

(3) What is binary languages ?
(A) -> Binary languages is a machine language.
    -> Binary language consists of bits of 1 and zeros.
    -> Electronic devices can't understand the human language. So in order to communicate with the
       electronic devices with the help of electricty binary language is created. In this binary
       language, a 5 volt is taken as binary bit 1 and a 0 volt is taken as binary bit 0.

(4) What are the roles of operating system ?
(A) -> Operating system is like a face to the computer through which we can communicate with the
       hardware of the computer.
    -> Operating system is a program that can assigns the jobs to ROM, RAM, Processor.....etc.
    -> It is the control unit.
    -> Through operating system we can give the instructions to these computer system.
