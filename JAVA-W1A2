(1) Write most popular compilers for c , c++, java ?
(A) -> for c, GCC compiler is the most used  and recommended compiler. there are other compilers
       for c like minGW, GNU..etc.
    -> For c++ also GCC compiler is most recommended compiler. There are other compilers like VC
       ++, GNU..etc.
    -> For java, Javac is the most used compiler. the other compilers are GNU.

(2) Memory architecture in computer ?
(A) Memory architecture in a computer consists of 4 main units. they are 
    (a) Hard disk memory :
        -> I t is called primary memory.
        -> A large amount of data can be stored in this memory unit when compared to RAM.
        -> Harddisk uses magnetic disks to store the data.
        -> Data stored in the harddisk cannot dissappear even if the power is turned off.
    (b) Random Axis Memory :
        -> It is the primary memory unit.
        -> It is made up of semi-conductors.
        -> Data transmission in this memory unit is high compared to harddisk.
        -> We can read and write the data in the RAM.
        -> It uses frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system.
    (c) Read Only Memory :
        -> It is also made up of semi-conductor.
        -> The capacity of this memory is less than RAM and higher than cache.
        -> It stores the data even if the power is turned off.
        -> We can only read the memory in it.
        -> When the system is powered on, Immediatly bootstrap program in ROM transfers the O.S
           from harddisk to RAM to control the system.
    (d) Cache Memory : 
        -> Just like RAM and Rom, Cache is made up of semi-conductors.
        -> Its functioning is similar to RAM except it is very nearer to C.P.U.
        -> It stores program instructions that are frequently re-referenced by software during
           operation
 
(3) List of high level languages? Reason ?
(A)     Python, Visual basic, Delphi, Perl, PHP, Java Script, Ruby, SQL,  are the some of the high
    level languages. All these languages are high level programming languages because of the same
    reason i.e abstraction.
        Abstraction is nothing but suppressing the more complex details in a device and using a 
    easy operation to use it.
        A high level language deals with variables, arrays, objects loops and other computer
    science objects rather than register, memory address and call stacks. Higher level language
    refers to higher-level of abstraction from machine language.
         All the listed high level languages are highly abstracted languages.
